YouTube Channel Data Analysis Application
1. Project Overview
The purpose of this application is to allow users to access, analyze, and manage data from multiple YouTube channels. Built using Streamlit, the application provides functionality for retrieving data from YouTube channels, storing it for further analysis, and searching through the stored data.

2. Features
YouTube Channel Data Retrieval

Users can input a YouTube Channel URL to fetch details using the Google YouTube Data API.
Data fetched includes:
Channel Name
Subscriber Count
Total Video Count
Playlist ID
Video Details (ID, Title, Likes, Dislikes, Comments)
Data Storage

Retrieve data from up to 10 YouTube channels.
Store the data in a data lake (e.g., local storage or cloud).
Save the data to either a MySQL or PostgreSQL database for structured querying.
Search and Analysis

Retrieve data from the SQL database based on user-defined search options.
Execute advanced SQL queries, including joins, to combine channel and video data for insights.
Options to filter results by specific criteria such as video likes, comments, etc.
3. Architecture

3.1 System Flow
User inputs a YouTube Channel ID.
Application retrieves data via the Google YouTube Data API.

Data is stored:
In a temporary data lake for immediate use.
In a relational database for persistent storage.
User searches and analyzes the data using SQL-based queries.

4. Technology Stack

4.1 Frontend
Streamlit: Interactive UI for input, visualization, and search options.

4.2 Backend
Google YouTube Data API: For fetching channel and video data.
Python: Core programming language for data processing.

4.3 Database
MySQL or PostgreSQL: For storing and querying channel/video data.

4.4 Data Storage
Data Lake: Temporary local storage or cloud-based solutions for intermediate data storage.

4.5 Libraries and Tools
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
sqlalchemy: ORM for database interactions.
streamlit: Frontend framework for the app.
google-auth: To authenticate with the Google YouTube Data API.

5. Key Functional Components
5.1 Input Module
Accepts YouTube Channel IDs.
Validates the input format.

5.2 API Integration Module
Connects to the Google YouTube Data API.
Fetches channel and video data based on the Channel ID.
Handles API errors and retries for robustness.

5.3 Data Storage Module
Saves data into two layers:
Data Lake: For raw data storage.
Relational Database: For structured data storage.
5.4 Search and Analysis Module

Provides a search bar to filter stored data.
Supports SQL query execution for advanced filtering and joining.
5.5 Visualization Module
Displays retrieved data using Streamlit widgets (tables, graphs, etc.).

6. Installation Guide

6.1 Prerequisites
Python (3.8 or higher)
Google Cloud Console account (for API key)
MySQL/PostgreSQL installed and configured.

6.2 Steps to Install
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database:
Configure MySQL/PostgreSQL and create the necessary tables.
Configure the Google API key in .env file:
plaintext
Copy code
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py


7. Usage Instructions
Launch the application using the terminal command.
Enter a YouTube Channel ID in the provided input box.
Click "Fetch Data" to retrieve channel and video information.
Click "Save to Database" to store data in MySQL/PostgreSQL.
Use the Search tab to query the stored data using filters or SQL commands.

8. Database Schema
8.1 Tables
Channels Table: Stores channel-related data.
id, name, subscriber_count, video_count, playlist_id
Videos Table: Stores video-specific data.
id, title, channel_id, likes, dislikes, comments_count

8.2 Relationships
One-to-Many: A channel can have multiple videos.

9. Error Handling
API Error: Display user-friendly error messages and retry options.
Input Validation: Ensure correct format for YouTube Channel IDs.
Database Errors: Catch exceptions and provide suggestions for resolution.

10. Future Enhancements
Add support for analyzing video trends.
Integrate machine learning models to predict channel growth.
Export retrieved data as CSV/Excel.
Support additional databases like MongoDB.
